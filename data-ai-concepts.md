## II Data and AI Foundation
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

*Topics Covered: Data and AI Introduction, Mathematics, IT/Programming, Business Domain*

In this section, I am going to build the foundation that is necessary to grasp before looking at components of data and AI platform. 

And we will start from scratch, first we will cover the basic concepts of data and AI and how these fields are connected, then we will focus on core concepts of mathematics, IT/programming and business domain etc.

### 1 Data and AI Introduction

#### 1.1 Data Concepts 
*Topics Covered: Data, Data Vs Information, DIKW Pyramid, Different Aspects of Data (Formats, Scope, Biases), Structured, Semi-structured and Unstructured Data, Data Usage (Scientific Research, Business Management, Finance, Governance), Data Analysis*

##### 1.1.1 Data
Data is the back-bone of data-driven AI. So lets first understand what is data? 

Data is the raw fact without any context i.e. a number, symbol, character, word, codes, graphs, etc. 

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*IPkspG9qDOTW8AZK2Oq3aw.png){:width="100%"}

Data has originated as a plural form of Latin word 'Datum', which means 'a given fact'.

Broadly speaking, it can be any information in digital form, it can be output of sensing device or organ.

Loosely, data and information are used interchangeably, which is not correct, we will cover the difference in an upcoming section.

Data, information, knowledge and wisdom are closely related concepts, but each has its own role in relation to the other, and each term has its own meaning, we will also touch this part soon.

##### 1.1.2 Datum, Data and Dataset

Mostly we talk about data but occassionally, you may hear terms like datum or dataset, lets understand the difference. Datum is single piece of information, which can be treated as an observation. Data is plural of datum, which we can say multiple observations. Dataset is a homogenous collection of data (each datum must have the same focus).

##### 1.1.3 Information
When data is processed and put into context, it becomes information, which can be utilized by humans in significant way i.e. making decisions, forecasting etc

##### 1.1.4 Knowledge and Wisdom
When we put relevant information to work in a specific domain, it becomes knowledge. And when that knowledge is enhanced with first-hand experience, it becomes wisdom.

Lets relate it to an example:
- '100' number is data
- '100 miles' is information
- '100 miles is quite a far distance' is a knowledge
- '100 miles is very difficult to walk' is wisdom.

##### 1.1.5 Different Aspects of Data

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*OSLT07CT7TTWXrYNmmYomA.png){:width="100%"}

###### Formats of Data
We can classify data formats in three categories as structured, semi-structured and unstructured:
- Structured data has a definite structure like table with rows and columns.
- Semi-structured data has some structure like JSON, key-value or graph database.
- Unstructured data has no specific structure like photos, audio and video files.

###### Scope of Data
Data can be classified in two categories based on scope:
- Population, which means we have access to all the data
- Sample, which means only a portion is available or feasible

###### Biases in Data
Bias in data means over or under-representation of a sub-population, may not be intentional.
- Omission: using arguements from only one side
- Source selection: including more authoritative sources from one side 
- Story selection: sharing stories that agree with one side
- Placement: unimportant stories gets important placement in reputed media platforms
- Labelling: labeled on one side or missing labels on other side
- Spin: stories providing only one interpretation of an event
