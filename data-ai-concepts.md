## II Data and AI Foundation
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

*Topics Covered: Data and AI Introduction, Mathematics, IT/Programming, Business Domain*

Note: This section is still being written...

In this section, I am going to build the foundation that is necessary to grasp before looking at components of data and AI platform. 

And we will start from scratch, first we will cover the basic concepts of data and AI and how these fields are connected, then we will focus on core concepts of technology and business domain etc.

#### 2.1 Science, Engineering and Technology

Technology plays an integral part in Data and AI space, it's customary to have a decent understanding of tech space in general to make the most of data and AI capabilities.

Before understanding technology, its important to understand the difference between science, engineering, and technology.

The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not very clear but we can understand the difference by these elaborations:

1. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical (or material) world which we gain via observation and experimentation.

2. Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means.

3. Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, it is the sum of any techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives.


#### 2.2 Technology

The word 'technology' has emerged from the Greek word 'techne' which means 'art, skill, the cunning of hand'. 

The simplest form of technology is the development and usage of basic tools. 

From the prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools to the invention of the internet in modern times, technology has evolved a lot.

On one hand, technology has helped us in developing advanced economies, on the other hand, its unwanted by-products have proven to be detrimental to our environment.

There are valid philosophical debates on the use of technology and whether it improves or worsens the human condition.

Information technology is a branch of technology that deals with electronic data and information, we will discuss that in the next section.
