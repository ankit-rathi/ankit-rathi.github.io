How I Use Valuation to Make Better Decisions

One of the most common mistakes investors make is confusing **stock price** with **valuation**. A stock price tells you what one share is trading at. **Valuation tells you what the entire business is worth**. These are two very different things.

That’s why valuation analysis sits at the core of my investing process.

### There Is No One-Size-Fits-All Valuation Metric

Different businesses need different valuation lenses. Depending on the industry, I use metrics like **P/E**, **P/B**, **EV/EBITDA**, or **Market Cap to Sales**.
Banks and financials often make sense on P/B or ROE-based metrics. Capital-intensive businesses may be better judged on EV/EBITDA. Consumer or platform businesses may justify higher P/E ratios.

The key point: **no single ratio works for all stocks**.

### Valuation Is Always Relative

Once I choose the right valuation metric, I don’t look at it in isolation. I compare it against three things:

1. **Broader market valuation**
2. **Industry or peer group valuation**
3. **The company’s own historical valuation range**

This gives context and helps me judge whether the stock is **undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued**.

### Example: NSE – Reliance Industries (Illustrative)

Let’s take **Reliance Industries** as an example to understand this better.

Assume its **5-year median P/E is around 26**. Historically, the stock may have traded:

* Near **24 P/E** during pessimistic phases (undervalued zone)
* Around **28 P/E** during euphoric phases (overvalued zone)

If the business fundamentals remain intact and the stock moves closer to the lower end of its historical valuation range, **risk reduces and probability improves**. That’s where accumulation makes sense.
When the stock trades well above its historical comfort zone, **future returns compress**, and it may be time to reduce or exit.

This is not about predicting tops or bottoms. It’s about **playing ranges and probabilities**.

### Valuation Helps Improve Odds, Not Certainty

The logic is simple.
**Buy strong businesses when they are undervalued.
Sell or reduce when they become overvalued.**

Do this consistently, and you’re no longer dependent on luck or market mood. You’re letting **probability work in your favour**.

And remember—P/E is just one example here. Depending on the business, **any relevant valuation parameter can be used**, and the same framework applies **when comparing industry valuations and broader market valuations** as well. What matters is discipline, context, and consistency.

Have a good day,
