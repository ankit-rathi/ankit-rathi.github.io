I have worked on various data science projects till date, but I feel that theoretically I still need to cover a lot of ground, that too when the field itself is evolving. In order to do that, I am reading couple of books on data science and making notes to refer in future.

Recently, I have published similar series on *Probability & Statistics for Data Science:*

This series will cover my notes on *‘Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)’*, here I have tried to give intuitive understanding of key concepts and how these concepts are connected to statistical learning.

This blog-post series will be covering following topics:

1\. [*Statistical Learning*](https://medium.com/@rathi.ankit/statistical-learning-for-data-science-b61b263c1196) blog-post introduces the basic terminology and concepts behind statistical learning.

2\. [*Linear Regression*](https://medium.com/@rathi.ankit/linear-regression-for-statistical-learning-cb43593a3999) & [*Classification*](https://medium.com/@rathi.ankit/classification-statistical-learning-9b10bc4acd67) blog-posts cover classical linear methods for regression and classification.

3\. [*Resampling Methods*](https://medium.com/@rathi.ankit/resampling-methods-statistical-learning-8c3da6fe6d24) blog-post discuss various methods estimate the accuracy of a number of different methods in order to choose the best one.

4\. *Linear Model Selection and Regularization* blog-post consider a host of linear methods, which offer potential improvements over standard linear regression.

6\. *Moving Beyond Linearity* blog-post introduces us to the world of non-linear statistical learning.

7\. *Tree-Based Methods* blog-post covers tree-based methods including bagging, boosting, and random forests.

8\. *Support Vector Machines* blog-post as the name suggests covers intuitive understanding of SVMs.

9\. *Unsupervised Learning* blog-post considers a setting in which we have input variables but no output variable.

If you are looking for similar learning curve, stay tuned.
