*In this post, I have analyzed frequent challenges encountered by DS/AI leaders & experts in their projects/initiatives. I have re-organized these challenges into 4 areas of concerns, my idea is to build a framework around these challenges to suggest possible solutions in upcoming posts.*

DS/AI promises considerable economic & social benefits, even as it disrupts the way we work. Almost everyone agrees that it is a field which can change the world, from healthcare to countering terrorism and even arts & sports.

DS/AI leaders & experts are facing different challenges from ideation to productization, it is estimated that between 70% and 85% of DS/AI projects fail.

To get a holistic view of the challenges & failures, I looked at various articles available on the internet about the challenges in DS/AI projects & initiatives. You can find all the articles I referred at the end of this post.

In the past few weeks, I have also spoken to many DS/AI leaders & experts on this topic and they have also given some useful insights. I will cover these specific insights into the challenges in the upcoming blog-posts.

In order to shed some light on the reasons why we observe such a high failure rate, I also analyzed the results of a survey conducted by Kaggle in 2017. You can see the full report [here](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017). The part of the survey relevant to this article is about the challenges companies face as far as their DS/AI efforts are concerned. The following chart shows the top fifteen challenges:

While I am still documenting the challenges & possible solutions, I can categorize these challenges in four broad segments: — Cultural challenges (right talent, data literacy, realistic expectations etc) — Data-related challenges (data access, data quality, lifecycle management etc) — Operational challenges (suitable operating model with specific roles & responsibilities) — Technology-related challenges (appropriate tech-stack, right infrastructure etc).

### Challenges in DS/AI Projects

Based on the above-mentioned sources (surveys, articles & experts) in this post, I have collected all the challenges and tried to categorize them into four areas of concern — Culture, Operation, Data, Technology:

-   Data Quality — Data
-   Talent Gap — Operations
-   Company Politics — Culture
-   Data Access — Operations
-   Data Literacy — Culture
-   Data Privacy — Data
-   SME Gap — Operations
-   Heterogeneous Tech-stack — Technology
-   Unrealistic Expectations — Culture
-   Co-ordination with IT & other deptt — Operations
-   Stakeholders’ Buy-in — Culture
-   Sponsorship — Culture
-   Deployment — Operations
-   Algorithms Limitations — Technology
-   Data Consolidation — Data
-   Opportunity Assessment — Operations
-   Model Explainability — Technology
-   Agility — Operations
-   Data Security — Operations
-   Solving the Wrong Problem — Operations
-   Organizational Maturity — Culture
-   Storytelling — Culture

### Area of Concerns in DS/AI

Now, let’s consolidate the above challenges in the respective area of concerns:

#### Cultural Challenges

Company Politics, Data Literacy, Unrealistic Expectations, Stakeholders’ Buy-in, Organizational Maturity, Storytelling

#### Operational Challenges

Talent Gap, Data Access, SME Gap, Coordination with IT and other deptts, Deployment, Opportunity Assessment, Data Security, Solving the Wrong Problem

#### Data Challenges

Data Quality, Data Privacy, Data Consolidation

#### Technology Challenges

Heterogeneous Tech-stack, Algorithms Limitations, Model Explainability

### What next?

I believe that if we categorize these challenges in the respective area of concerns, we can build a framework around it which can address these challenges and suggest possible solutions.

I intend to explore these possibilities in the upcoming blog-posts, if it looks interesting to you, stay tuned.
