title: 3 Aspects of Data Systems Design
---

While designing a data system, apart from functional requirements, we need to tackle non-functional requirements (NFRs) as well.

Few NFRs (Security, Compliance, Interoperability etc) are subjective to the use case, but few NFRs (Reliability, Scalability and Maintainability) are common across all data systems.

Reliability means the system should be reliable in the face of any adversity

Scalability means that there should be reasonable ways to deal with system's growth

Maintainability means that over time, engineering and operations team should be able to work on the system productively.

We will continue to explore these terms in more depth one by one in upcoming posts.
