While designing and building Data & AI platforms, you may need to evaluate the options available. Whether your platform would be on-premise or you could use cloud/s services or you would take a hybrid approach.
In any case, you may need to look and evaluate various tools & services for your ingestion, storage, process/analysis and serving layers.
In this post, I have mapped open-source and popular managed cloud services to make our evaluation process a bit easier.

I will be comparing these services with their pros and cons and when to use which service in upcoming posts, stay tuned.
I hope you find this post useful, stay tuned for more, any feedback would be highly appreciated.
