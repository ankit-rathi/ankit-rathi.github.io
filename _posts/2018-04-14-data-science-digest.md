Data Science is an amalgamation of many other fields like mathematics, technology & domain; it has its own concepts, process & tools. It’s really tough to know each and everything related to the subject unless you have really worked on complex data science problems in industry for couple of years.

In this post, I have tried to aggregate & organize all the data science related topics from Quora (generic definitions), Medium (in-depth working) & GitHub (code). This post is organized in these sections of data science area:

1.  Introduction
2.  Prerequisites
3.  Concepts
4.  Algorithms
5.  Process
6.  Tools
