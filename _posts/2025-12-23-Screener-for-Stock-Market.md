Selecting Robust Businesses

The main objective of this post is to provide a practical, time-efficient method to filter thousands of listed stocks down to a manageable list of high-quality companies for trading. 

The key takeaways from the sources are as follows:

### 1. The Challenge of Scale
There are between **1,500 to 2,000 companies listed on the NSE** and approximately **5,000 on the BSE**. It is not practically possible for a trader to track the financial results or news for every single company. Instead, the goal is to filter these down to a "trackable" list of **130 to 160 companies** to which technical chart patterns and strategies can then be applied.

### 2. The Recommended Tool: Screener.in
The source recommends using **Screener.in** as the most effective tool for accessing financial information. While a paid version exists, the session highlights that the **free version is sufficient** for creating custom screens and identifying top-tier companies.

### 3. Five Essential Filtering Criteria
To identify "great companies," the session outlines five specific financial metrics to enter into the query builder:
*   **Debt to Equity Ratio < 0.25:** This ensures that the company’s debt is no more than 25% of the shareholders' equity.
*   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) > 20%:** This identifies companies that are highly efficient at generating profits from their capital.
*   **Net Profit > 200 (Crores):** This filters for established companies with a significant profit baseline.
*   **Public Holding < 30%:** A very high public holding can sometimes be a cause for concern; keeping this under 30% helps filter for stronger ownership structures.
*   **Pledging Percentage < 10%:** This ensures that the promoters have not pledged an excessive amount of their shares.

Running this query typically results in a list of about **128 high-quality companies**, including well-known names like TCS, HUL, and ITC.

### 4. Accounting for Banks and NBFCs
The criteria mentioned above (specifically ROCE > 20%) often **exclude banking and NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) stocks** because their business models naturally result in lower ROCE. To complete your list, you should manually add:
*   The **top 10 banks** by market capitalization.
*   The **top 20 NBFCs** by market capitalization.

This brings the total watch-list to approximately **158 companies**.

### 5. Practical Data Management
*   **Manual Export:** Since the "Export to Excel" button is a paid feature, you can **copy the data directly from the screen and paste it into an Excel file** to create your own master list. 
*   **Watch-lists:** Once identified, these companies should be added to a **TradingView watch-list** for regular monitoring. Note that the free version of TradingView has limits on the number of watch-lists, which may require specific workarounds.

**Analogy for Understanding:**
Think of the stock market like a massive ocean with thousands of fish. You cannot catch them all, and many are not worth your time. The **Screener query** acts like a **specialized net** with specific mesh sizes: it lets the small, debt-ridden, or unprofitable fish swim away, leaving you with only the "prize catches." Because some valuable species (like banks) don't fit the standard net, you simply go back with a smaller hand-net to pick the very best of them individually.
