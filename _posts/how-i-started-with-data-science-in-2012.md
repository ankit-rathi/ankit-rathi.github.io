As of today, I have around 15K+ followers on LinkedIn, and at least 10 connections in a day ask me how they can start or build their career in data science. As I see it, the problem is not that there is a dearth of resources but the problem is that there are plethora of resources (MOOCs, Books, YouTube, Blogs, Paid Certificates etc) out there and a newbie gets overwhelmed.

While a particular path chosen can’t be absolutely right or completely wrong, I believe one should choose resources based on his learning & adaptability preferences to optimize his learning path. I have written a couple of posts in the past for newbies on how to learn data science; today, let me share my journey with the starters/newbies to give them an idea how it is like to get into data science.

I started my career in 2005 working with Oracle (SQL & PL/SQL), over the period of time, I got to work on other operational databases (SQL Server, MySQL etc) along with designing DWH building ETL pipelines and building BI dashboards on top of DWH.

In 2012, I read the famous article by Thomas H. Davenport & D. J. Patil in Harvard Business Review titled as [Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). As I was working with databases & data warehouses, I got curious what this data scientist is and how his work would be different than mine. While digging for data science, I came across [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. I attended that course and while I was able to learn most of the theory out of it, I was looking for some hands-on, then I got introduced to Kaggle and the first problem I worked was [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

By 2013, I was in a position to suggest my employer to start with a PoC on data science in our department. As it was a very new field that time, I had a hard time to convince people why should they invest time & resources in it. In the mean time, I kept working on Kaggle competitions, public data-sets, learning statistics/probability, keeping a tab on emerging trends.

Finally in 2014, I got the chance to work upon a use-case, where I was able to convince the stakeholders how data science is different from traditional analytics. As I had a background of data design/architecture, initially I got data science use-cases as an added responsibility while working on traditional IT projects. But once I got started with that, there was no looking back.

Since then, I have worked on many interesting problems and because of my background, I have also built many data science platforms from scratch to enable the team of data scientists either for our customers or our business. In my current role, I work with a team of data engineers & data scientists to build & enrich data science platforms.

While working on data science use-cases and projects/products, I got to learn many things; on one hand, I learnt how data quality (and hence data governance) is important for the success of data science projects/products; on the other hand I got exposure to hypothesis testing on sample data during the PoCs to ascertain whether the use case can be progressed as a data science project or product.

This is my journey till where I stand today, as its an ever evolving field, there are gaps between theoretical aspects and real-world problems we are trying to solve. One very important thing that I have learnt that it is a team sport. An individual can not have all the skills required to work on a data science project so we need to have diversified skill-sets within the team, from business/domain, from math (statistics/probability) & from software/data engineering. We meet new challenges almost everyday (technical as well as non-technical), and we keep learning, discussing, trying till those are resolved.

So what can you learn from my journey? Keep exploring, keep learning, keep working on some interesting problems/projects, keep interacting with people in the same field, learn from experienced people, guide the starters/newbies based on what you have learnt till now.
