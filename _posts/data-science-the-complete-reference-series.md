*In Data Science, great books have been written, excellent courses have been launched, yet I feel there is nothing like ‘The Complete Reference’ or ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide To’ kind of reading or reference material. You can consider this post as a reference for any topic in Data Science (now AI).*

*Note: If you feel there is a topic not covered or there are better references available for certain topics, just let me know.*

I have been working in data & technology for last 13 years and in my initial years, I really loved the books named like ‘The Complete Reference’ or ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide To’. These books used to cover everything under the umbrella of the language/technology to sufficient depth so that the reader can start working and explore each topic further himself.

My idea of this post is to cover everything under the sun for Data Science field to a decent depth and connect these dots to put the big picture clear in the mind of the reader. Here I plan not to write everything from scratch, albeit I will refer existing articles & posts wherever I can.

#### 4.4 Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Bias occurs when an algorithm has limited flexibility to learn the true signal from a data-set. Variance refers to an algorithm’s sensitivity to specific sets of training data. An optimized data science model tries to find a balance between both.

Following post covers the bis-variance trade-off topic in detail.

### 6. Data Science Process

This section touches upon main processes used in data science projects.

#### 6.1 Business Understanding

Before you can even start on a data science project, it is critical that you understand the problem you are trying to solve. The data scientists should keep asking the why’s. They need to ensure that every decision made in the company is supported by data, and that it is highly probable to achieve results.

This post gives you a view on how to covert a business question to data science task.

\[embed\]https://medium.com/\@rathi.ankit/how-to-launch-your-ds-ai-career-in-12-weeks-8a7e6950ffe6\[/embed\]

#### 6.2 Data Understanding

The data understanding stage is like the brainstorming of data analysis. This is where you understand the patterns and bias in your data. It could involve pulling up and analyzing a random subset of the data using Pandas, plotting a histogram or distribution curve to see the general trend, or even creating an interactive visualization that lets you dive down into each data point and explore the story behind the outliers.

Following post provides a gentle introduction to EDA.

\[embed\]https://medium.com/\@rathi.ankit/how-to-launch-your-ds-ai-career-in-12-weeks-8a7e6950ffe6\[/embed\]

#### 6.3 Data Preparation

Data preparation or wrangling is the most time-consuming step of all, this is especially true in big data projects, which often involve terabytes of data to work with.

You can refer this post for the comprehensive introduction to data wrangling.

\[embed\]https://medium.com/\@rathi.ankit/how-to-launch-your-ds-ai-career-in-12-weeks-8a7e6950ffe6\[/embed\]

#### 6.4 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to transform your raw data into informative features that represent the business problem you are trying to solve. This stage will directly influence the accuracy of the predictive model you construct in the next stage.

Want to know more about feature engineering? Go through this post.

#### 6.5 Modeling & Validation

Predictive modeling is where the machine learning finally comes into your data science project. Based on the questions you asked in the business understanding stage, this is where you decide which model to pick for your problem. Once you’ve trained your model, it is critical that you evaluate its success. A process called k-fold cross validation is commonly used to measure the accuracy of a model.

Learn more about cross-validation here.

#### 6.6 Deployment & Hosting

Training a model is one thing, but deploying your model to solve a business problem is different. Deploying into production can mean something different for each one of you.

For some people putting a model into production means having the model accessible by anyone who can use it to calculate, measure or see something. For other people means having the model do something or interact with customers.

Take a look at one of the best options for deploying your deep learning models in this post.

#### 6.7 Monitoring & Maintenance

Model monitoring & maintenance is not particularly a favorite activity for anyone, but it is something that you really must do, and in fact, plan for before you even build your model.

Lets understand why your models need maintenance in this post.
