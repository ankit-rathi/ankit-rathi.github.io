Basic Principles of Stock Market

The foundational principles discussed in this session emphasize that success in the stock market is primarily dependent on **mindset, discipline, and practical knowledge**, rather than academic qualifications or theoretical expertise.

---

## 1. The Core Principles of Discipline and Mindset

- **Discipline is the First Rule:**  
  Discipline is identified as the fundamental rule for achieving success in the stock market and life.  
  A lack of discipline is a bad habit, not a lack of time.

- **Focus on Process, Not Immediate Results:**  
  Investors should focus on whether they followed the necessary steps (understanding the business, financials, and chart patterns) *before* taking a trade.  
  You are considered "right" if you followed the process — even if the stock goes down temporarily.  
  Profit or loss doesn’t define correctness; discipline does.

- **Avoid Constant Portfolio Monitoring:**  
  It’s unproductive to check your portfolio repeatedly if you’re neither booking a profit nor a loss.  
  Instead, focus on whether the stock reached your planned target.

- **Wisdom Over Intelligence:**  
  Stock market success requires **wisdom**, not just **intelligence**.  
  Even highly intelligent people (like Einstein) have lost money in the markets.  
  Degrees can guarantee a salary, but not financial freedom.

- **Humility is Essential:**  
  Ego must be left outside the market.  
  Titles like Manager, VP, or Director don’t matter here — the market humbles everyone.  
  Stay grounded and open-minded.

- **Sharpen Your Skills:**  
  Keep improving your **skills**, **knowledge**, **health**, and **character** —  
  that’s how you “sharpen the axe” for long-term success.

## 2. Understanding Market Mechanics and the Role of Operators

- **The 97% Rule:**  
  Around **97% of investors lose money** in the market.  
  The money flows from the pockets of the 97% to the successful 1–3%.  
  This losing crowd includes PhDs, CAs, and MNC managers.

- **Market is Not Gambling (If You Learn):**  
  Any activity without proper learning — whether driving or investing — is gambling.  
  Once learned and practiced professionally, it’s a skill.

- **Strong Hands Control the Market:**  
  Promoters, FIIs, DIIs, and HNIs — collectively called **Strong Hands** — dominate the market.  
  For example, they may collectively hold 82–97% of a company’s shares.

- **Price Movements Reflect Strong Hands’ Interests:**  
  When stock prices rise, promoters and fund managers gain in net worth or commission.  
  Hence, they benefit from higher prices in the long run.

- **Prices Are Temporarily Suppressed:**  
  Strong Hands may push prices down 25–30% to accumulate shares cheaply,  
  but cannot keep them low for long — it hurts their own interests.

- **Markets Can’t Stay Down Forever:**  
  Just as one can’t hold their breath indefinitely,  
  markets can’t stay suppressed — “Strong Hands” eventually lift prices.

- **Do the Opposite of the Majority:**  
  When 99% are selling, look to buy.  
  When 99% are buying, prepare to sell.  
  Contrarian thinking is often profitable.

## 3. Practical Steps for Success and Change

- **Avoid Media and Tips:**  
  Successful investors avoid TV anchors and tip-based investing.  
  Most anchors are not even allowed to trade in their personal accounts.

- **Seek Real News:**  
  Authentic updates come from **official company filings** on **NSE/BSE**  
  or reliable sites like **screener.in**.  
  Remember — news is *past tense*, predictions are *opinions*.

- **Money Management and Priorities:**  
  The 99% spend on instant pleasures — alcohol, gadgets, luxury.  
  The 1% prioritize education, saving, and investing.  
  Respect money; don’t waste it.

- **Economic Principles vs. Market Reality:**  
  Academic economics and the real market often move in opposite directions (90% of the time).  
  Practical understanding — like how GST or real estate trends affect business — is more valuable.

- **Holistic Development: Body, Mind, and Wealth:**  
  True success needs balance in three areas:  
  - **Tan (Body):** Physical fitness  
  - **Man (Mind/Character/Knowledge):** Meditation, learning, humility  
  - **Dhan (Wealth):** Smart investing  
  Weakness in one affects the others.

- **Focus on Self, Not Others:**  
  Don’t waste energy discussing others’ lives or achievements.  
  Focus on your own growth, habits, and mindset.

- **Reject Theoretical Knowledge:**  
  Bookish concepts won’t make you money.  
  The stock market rewards **practical learning and disciplined execution** — not theory.

### 🧭 In Summary

Stock market success isn’t about IQ or degrees —  
it’s about **discipline, wisdom, humility, and action**.  
Learn, unlearn, and practice — that’s how you move from the 97% to the 3%.
