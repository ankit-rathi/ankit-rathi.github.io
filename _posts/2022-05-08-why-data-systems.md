title: Why a generic term named Data Systems?
---

Why a generic Data Systems term is more suitable than Data Storage, Processing and Analytics Systems separately?

One reason is, as many storage tools also process and analzse, and many processing and analysis tools also stores data, the boundaries between the different capabilities are becoming blurred.

Another reason is, due to the demanding and wide range of requirements, no single tool can fulfill all the requirements, we generally end up using multiple tools for broken-down work and stitch them together.
