For Data Science & Machine Learning beginners, it is essential to develop a mathematical understanding of underlying concepts. Data Science is simply an evolved version of statistics and mathematics (combined with programming and business logic). Many data scientists struggle to explain intrinsic details of predictive models. More than just deriving accuracy, understanding & interpreting every metric, calculation behind that accuracy is important.

Even for a lot of higher level courses/books on Machine Learning/Data Science, you need to brush up on the basics in mathematics, but if you refer these topics in textbooks, you will find the Data Science context missing. This blog series targets to bridge that gap, it will cover all the underlying mathematics, to build an intuitive understanding, and you will be able to relate it to Machine Learning and Data Science.
