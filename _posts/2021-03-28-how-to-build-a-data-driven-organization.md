title: How to build a data-driven organization?
---

There has not been an exciting time than this to talk about data. Data is
everywhere, it is being called the new oil, it has become a strategic asset. An
organization’s success or failure is now quite dependent on whether it is able
to exploit the business value of the data available to them.

In this long blog post, I am going to cover an approach for an organization or
business to become data-driven. Why a data strategy is important? How we can
align it to business strategy? Which areas to focus on to become data-driven?
Which are the emerging technologies available to enable us in our data-driven
journey? When to use which technology? Why data science is just a part of the
whole puzzle? Why data governance is so important? How it enhances the business
value of data? Which aspects of data governance are critical? Why data-literacy
is important for business? How it can help to build data-driven culture? I will
explore all these areas and will provide answers to these questions.

I plan to organize my blog posts under the following titles:

* *Data-Driven, What & Why?*
* *Building Data Strategy*
* *Exploiting Emerging Technologies*
* *Applying Data Governance*
* *Building Data-Driven Culture*

So let's start…

### Data-Driven, What & Why?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*njmlj9ZxT5G3Kv5D){:width="100%"}

Countless surveys from many strategic consulting firms have shown how a
data-driven business can serve its customers better, improve its products & get
ahead of its competitors.

What is Data-Driven?

*“Data-driven means that progress in an activity is compelled by data, rather
than by intuition or by personal experience.” — Wikipedia*

So becoming data-driven means taking decisions based on data, using data as an
input to identify areas of improvement, getting insights to fix existing
problems & improve performance. The data-driven organizations collect, analyze &
get insights from data to identify opportunities & solve problems.

For business, becoming data-driven is about building tools, abilities, and, most
crucially, a culture that acts on data.

Why be Data-Driven?

Earlier, decisions on improving performance or generating new products were
taken either by the intuition of the leadership or the experience they had of
the industry. But the possibility to take feedback or insights from available
data has now changed the way of doing business.

*“Most organizations this desire will be to better understand one’s customers
and to improve products and services.” ~ Ernst & Young*

*“The organizations that were mostly data-driven had 4% higher productivity and
6% higher profits than the average.” ~ MIT Digital Business*

*“Data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to acquire customers, six
times as likely to retain those customers, and 19 times as likely to be
profitable as a result.” ~ McKinsey Global Institute*

Over the last few years, the prominence of data has increased. While the 3Vs
(volume, velocity & variety) of data have increased manifolds, recent
advancements in technology (big data, analytics & cloud) have enabled many
organizations to start or transform their business purely based on their ability
to process & analyze available data to them.

This has challenged the traditional way of doing business, many of the
businesses have transformed & optimized their processes taking the feedback from
data. They have shown how the data available to them can be utilized to improve
customer experience & products, optimize processes, identify
problems/opportunities & even monetize the data itself.

More & more organizations are now trying to do the same, they are exploring
innovative ways to collect, process & analyze data to transform their business
to remain competitive or strive & thrive in their business.

### *Building Data Strategy*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*LV6ca-GLldiIAwj4){:width="100%"}

Let's understand data strategy and explore how we can build it.

Data Strategy, What & Why?

*“Strategy is a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of
uncertainty.” ~ Wikipedia*

In a business, when an organization builds a high-level plan to achieve its
goals and to get or stay ahead of the competitors, it's called Business
Strategy. As data has become a strategic asset in this information age, every
business is going to be a data business. Hence when we integrate the insights
gathered from available data into our business strategy, we call it Data
Strategy.

Data strategy & business strategy has started complimenting each other, while
business strategy can steer data strategy, data strategy can drive business
strategy as well in innovative ways.

In a holistic way, as is any business strategy, a data strategy should be
actionable, relevant, evolutionary & integrated.

So, why do we require a data strategy? Data strategy provides a centralized
vision & foundation for data-related capabilities, be it identifying analytics
opportunities, resolving data problems, or applying data management. As data has
become a strategic asset, there has to be a data strategy to fully exploit its
business value to stay relevant & competitive in today’s evolving business
ecosystem.

How to build Data Strategy?

Depending on the type of business it is in, type of operations it performs, or
type of data it has, different data strategies can be built for different
organizations. In general, these are the areas that can be focused upon:

1.  *Quick-wins:* For any business, it really important to know or realize the ROI
asap. So first priority can be to identify areas of smaller impact and
turn-around. Based on the results, businesses would be more comfortable and
eager to invest for longer terms.
1.  *Improving business decisions:* Identifying how business decisions are being
taken right now and how available data can help businesses to make these
efficient more efficient and quick can be other areas to explore.
1.  *Improving operations:* As more and more operations using technology, enough
data is available to know which are parts of operations taking long to execute
and how those can be optimized.
1.  *Monetizing data:* For some organizations, data itself can become a product and
they need to identify and evaluate the ways to monetize it.

Above is not an exhaustive list of the steps that can be taken to build data
strategy as its subjective to the kind of business an organization is in, the
kind of problems it is facing, and the kind of opportunities it can identify
with available data. Based on these factors, the above aspects of data strategy
can be prioritized as well, i.e. for some businesses monetizing data can deliver
more value than optimizing operations.

### *Exploiting Emerging Technologies*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*m438qmdxkYcSqLuF){:width="100%"}

In this section, let's understand emerging technologies and explore how we can
exploit them.

Emerging technologies are a vast field (i.e. big data, data science, blockchain
are separate field of study) and constantly evolving, I am just giving you a
starting point and an approach to keep yourself updated.

Emerging Technologies, What & Why?

*“Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent
progressive developments within a field for competitive advantage.” ~ Wikipedia*

Emerging technologies (i.e. Big Data, Data Science, Cloud Computing, Blockchain
& IoT) develops an ecosystem that allows businesses to enhance their operations
and maximize their reach to the customers with minimal overhead. Also, the
fusion of these different wings unleashes a surge of new ideas for business
innovations regarding workflows, methodologies, services, and products.

So why should we care about emerging technologies? Emerging technologies and
their confluence has already started to disrupt the business ecosystems. There
are businesses now that are in existence because of emerging technologies only,
for traditional businesses as well, it has become customary to integrate these
technologies into their processes. All this is generating a huge amount of
valuable data which can be processed and analyzed further to get actionable
insights that can provide any business a huge advantage over its competitors.

How to exploit Emerging Technologies?

Because of the rapid advancements in computing power and technologies, it has
become necessary to stay abreast of the latest developments in the field of
technology. Following are the aspects that can be looked into in order to keep a
tab on and exploiting emerging technologies:

1.  *Stay updated:* Business teams on a high level and technology teams in-depth
need to be aware of the evolution in emerging technologies. Big Data, Analytics,
Cloud & IoT; what's going on right now? What are the new fields emerging? i.e.
Blockchain, Capsule Net, etc. What are the gaps they are filling in the
industry?
1.  *Know the use cases:* In order to know the relevance of the latest development
in technology w.r.t. to your industry, you should be aware of the use cases for
these technologies. Most of the time it happens that these use-cases give you an
idea of how these features of the technology can help you with your use-cases.
1.  *Assess the strengths & weaknesses: *As different technologies, products &
vendors are providing the same functionalities or services, technology teams
should assess the strengths & weaknesses of these features from each supplier
and evaluate which one fits the best in their use-cases. i.e Hadoop Vs Spark,
Azure Vs AWS, Cassandra Vs MongoDB, etc
1.  *Start with POC/Prototype: *In order to know the challenges & minimize the risk
associated, technology teams should start with POCs or prototypes. Initially, it
may look like an overhead but it will be wise to know the pros & cons with the
minimal investment.

### *Applying Data Governance*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*bo0EuLCjuE7sCiuw){:width="100%"}

In this section, let's understand data governance and explore how we can apply
it.

Data Governance is a field of study in itself, I am providing just an overview
here, I encourage you to explore further and build your own understanding.

Data Governance, What & Why?

*“Data governance is a defined process an organization follows to ensure
high-quality data exists throughout the complete lifecycle. “ ~ Wikipedia*

*“Data Governance is defined as the exercise of authority and control (planning,
monitoring, and enforcement) over the management of data assets. Data Governance
guides all other Data Management functions.” ~ DMBOK*

While business uses data as a strategic asset, there are certain aspects of data
i.e. data quality, master data, data security which impact the business value of
data. We need some framework & policies to manage these aspects which fall under
Data Governance.

So why should we care about data governance? Imagine you have everything in
place but data quality is not up to the mark, you don’t have complete or
accurate data, you are handling sensitive data but don’t have a security
framework in place. All these aspects affect the business value of data and need
to be managed via data governance.

How to apply Data Governance?

As discussed above, data governance is all about having frameworks & policies to
maintain data quality throughout its lifecycle. Following are the aspects
related to data governance:

* *Data Governance:* central knowledge domain that connects all the other
processes
* *Data Architecture Management:* to set rules, policies, standards, and models
for data collected, used, stored, managed, and integrated within an organization
* *Data Development:* to manage data solutions in order to maximize the value of
the data resources to the enterprise
* *Data Operations Management:* to manage data-related operations in order to
maximize the value of the data resources to the enterprise.
* *Data Security Management:* to provide proper authentication, authorization,
access, and auditing of data and information assets
* *Reference and Master Data Management:* to manage shared data to ensure
consistency across the organization
* *Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence:* to manage decision support data
for reporting and analysis
* *Document and Content Management: *to manage the lifecycle of data outside
databases
* *Metadata Management:* to ensure proper creation, storage, integration of
metadata (data about data)
* *Data Quality Management:* to measure, assess, improve & ensure fitness of data
for enterprise

### *Building Data-Driven Culture*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*imAW58rOzzdI0XzZ){:width="100%"}

In this section, let's understand the data-driven culture and explore how we can
build it in our organization.

Data-Driven Culture, What & Why?

*“A data-driven culture is a workplace environment that employs a consistent,
repeatable approach to tactical and strategic decision-making through emphatic
and empirical data proof.”*

A data-driven culture is about setting the foundation for the habits and
processes around the use of data. Data-driven companies establish processes and
operations to make it easy for employees to acquire the required information but
are also transparent about data access restrictions and governance methods.

So, why is it important to build a data-driven culture in your organization? The
data can only take an organization so far. The real drivers are the people and
hence building the culture around data is important. Analytics leaders must
bring in the right talent, lead by example, and know when not to rely on data.

How to build Data-Driven Culture?

These are the aspects that an organization can work upon to build data-driven
culture:

* *Promote Data Literacy:* To keep business & technology teams on the same page
and collaborate effectively, it's really required to promote data literacy for
all. Both teams should know what the other team is doing and why to make the
most of the data-driven approach.
* *Create Single-Source of Truth: *To eliminate data-silos, to provide the most
accurate information at any given time & to democratize data access, an
organization must create a single-source of truth.
* *Make Data Accessible: *Unless data is accessible to all employees, it's
impractical to expect the business to be truly data-driven. Employees should be
skilled, informed & enthusiastic about using data to improve business.
* *Invest in Self-Service Analytics: *After doing all the above, still illusionary
to assume an organization data-driven if most of the employees don’t have the
right tools to make the most of available data. As not everybody can be a data
scientist, hence there is a need to identify appropriate self-service analytics
tools to empower business users.

Above is not an exhaustive list of steps to build a data-driven culture, but
it's enough business to get started and evolve in the future.
