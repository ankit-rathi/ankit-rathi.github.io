When I look at the literature available on probability & statistics, I find it too theoretical and generalized. I have felt that there should be some content on probability & statistics specifically focused on data science.

I want to cover here everything about *probability & statistics* from *basics* to *statistical learning*. I would like to mention that my focus in these posts would be to give intuition on every topic and how it relates to data science rather going deep into mathematical formulas.

This series will contain 6 posts, this one is the [*pilot*](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-statistics-for-data-science-series-83b94353ca48) which gives an overview and set the context of subsequent posts.

[*Second*](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-for-data-science-9770b26643d0) post will cover probability & its types, random variables & probability distributions and how they are important from data science perspective.

**Probability**

-   Introduction
-   Conditional Probability
-   Random Variables
-   Probability Distributions

[*Sixth* (*final*)](https://medium.com/@rathi.ankit/statistical-learning-for-data-science-b61b263c1196) post will cover statistical learning, it will be about looking at machine learning or data science from statistical perspective.

**Statistical Learning**

-   *Introduction*
-   *Prediction & Inference*
-   *Parametric & Non-parametric methods*
-   *Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability*
