How My Quantvesting Framework Picks the Top 5 Stocks?

People often ask me a simple question:

**How does your Quantvesting framework actually select the top 5 stocks?**

This post explains the logic — without code, jargon, or complexity.

### Step 1: Every Stock Is First Put into the Right Bucket

Before ranking begins, I **classify each stock** based on two things:

#### **Business Quality**

* **X** → Exceptional business
* **H** → High-quality business
* **M** → Medium-quality business

This reflects how strong, consistent, and reliable the business is.

#### **Company Size**

* **LC** → Large-cap
* **MC** → Mid-cap
* **SC** → Small-cap

So:

* **X-LC** = Exceptional Large-Cap business
* **H-MC** = High-quality Mid-Cap business
* **M-SC** = Medium-quality Small-Cap business

This ensures I **don’t compare apples with oranges**.

---

### Step 2: Every Stock Is Evaluated Through Four Lenses

Each stock is scored across four dimensions:

#### **1. Value**

Is the stock reasonably priced today?

* How far it is from long-term averages
* Whether earnings justify the price

Lower stress on valuation = better rank.

---

#### **2. Growth**

Is the business growing?

* Sales growth
* Profit growth

Faster and healthier growth ranks higher.

---

#### **3. Quality**

Is the business durable?

* Profitability
* Cash-flow strength
* Scale and consistency

High-quality businesses survive cycles.

---

#### **4. Momentum**

How is the market treating the stock right now?

* Recent price performance
* Strength versus peers

This avoids buying into weakening trends.

---

### Step 3: Ranking, Not Predictions

For every metric:

* Stocks are **ranked relative to each other**
* Better performance = better rank

No forecasts.
No narratives.
Just comparison.

---

### Step 4: Balance Over Brilliance

Within each category (Value, Growth, Quality, Momentum), ranks are **added together**.

This ensures:

* No single factor dominates
* Stocks must do reasonably well across dimensions

Consistency beats perfection.

---

### Step 5: Fair Comparison Comes First

Stocks are **first ranked within their own conviction bucket**
(for example, X-LC stocks against other X-LC stocks).

Only then are they ordered across buckets using a **pre-defined priority**:
Exceptional businesses first, followed by high-quality and medium-quality — adjusted for size.

This keeps risk under control.

---

### The Final Output: Cumulative Rank

Everything flows into one number:
**Cumulative Rank (CumlRnk)**

* Rank 1 = strongest overall balance
* Top 5 ranks = framework’s current best opportunities

No manual tweaking.
No emotional overrides.

---

### The Core Philosophy

Quantvesting doesn’t chase certainty.
It **improves decision quality**.

It enforces:

* Discipline over emotion
* Structure over stories
* Process over prediction

And over time, that discipline compounds.

That’s the real edge.
