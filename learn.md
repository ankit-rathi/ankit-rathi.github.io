## Sets, functions and relations

A set is a collection of objects, such as the finite set of colors the
(countably) infinite set of non-negative integers or the (uncountably) infinite
set of real-numbers.

A function is a mapping from a set of points X, known as the domain, to another set
of points Y, known as the codomain, such that there is a unique value y for each x.

The image of a set under a function f, denoted f(A), is the subset of the codomain of
obtainable values. The image of f, also called its range, is the image of its
domain, f(X).
