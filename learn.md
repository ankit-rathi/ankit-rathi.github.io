## Sets, functions and relations

A set is a collection of objects, such as the finite set of colors the
(countably) infinite set of non-negative integers or the (uncountably) infinite
set of real-numbers.

A function is a mapping from a set of points X, known as the domain, to another set
of points Y, known as the codomain, such that there is a unique value y for each x.
