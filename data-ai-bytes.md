# Daily Data and AI Bytes

>     As a data professional, a basic yet important thing to keep reminding ourselves everyday is that we are here to solve business problems.

> The very first question to ask is whether the business problem at hand really requires an ML/AI solution?

> If the business problem really requires an ML/AI solution, define the problem further and agree on the KPIs with business stakeholders.

> So you have analyzed if the ML/AI solution would be feasible for the business problem you are working on.
> You have also defined the problem further and agreed on KPIs with the business.
> What's next?
> Where is the data? Is it available? Is it accessible? What is the format? Any privacy or other regulatory constraints? Can you legally use it?

> Two extreme ends of ML/AI project feasibility assessment:
> 1. If there are clear and evident patterns in data, why to go for ML/AI?
> 2. If there are no patterns in data, why to go for ML/AI?
> Everything in between is a candidate for evaluation.

> You need to almost always start with PoC (proof of concept) in ML/AI use cases, why?
> - it minimizes the risk
> - it validate the feasibility quickly
> - it generates immediate insights
> - it aligns project stakeholders' expectations

> During the PoC, keep the end-to-end solution or product in mind, keep the modeling part simple initially.

> As a general rule:
> - If the patterns in data are simple and static, ML/AI may not be required.
> - If the patterns in data are complex and dynamic, ML/AI may be useful there.

> Business domain is an important aspect of ML/AI use cases,
> you may need to explicitly build features around the domain to guide ML/AI models if the patterns are not evident in the data itself.
> That's where domain experts are required, the step is called feature engineering.

> Every ML/AI use case has different requirements,
> don't reuse the same data across different ML/AI use cases.
> Validate the scope for current ML/AI use case independently.

> How frequent do you need the predictions?
> Real-time? Near real-time? Every hour? Every day?
> How frequent do you need to train your model?
> Every day? Every week? Every month? Every quarter?
> This is also an important aspect, given that it can also change over time.
> A lot of design, infra and monitoring aspects depends on it.
