Hey,

I'm a seasoned Data & AI professional with nearly two decades of experience turning raw data into real-world impact. My journey started in 2005 as a SQL developer and evolved through roles in PL/SQL, ETL, data architecture, machine learning, and now modern data platforms.

Along the way, I became a Kaggle Competitions Expert, spoke at conferences like PyData and Kaggle Days, and published two books to help others grow in this space.

Today, I help experienced ML/AI professionals and business leaders cut through the hype, make strategic bets, and build AI systems that actually work.

I sit at the intersection of:

- Applied ML/DL/LLM knowledge
- Product thinking and solution design
- Business strategy and decision-making
- Responsible and ethical AI deployment

I also built Quantvesting, my own data-driven investing framework — blending personal passion with technical depth.

Let’s connect if you're navigating the Data & AI space and value clarity, impact, and grounded thinking.
